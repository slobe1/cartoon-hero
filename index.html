             <!-- Description. Refine and shorten maybe. This is some ad copy shit. -->
            <p class="desc">Did you know fidgeting is caused by a feeling of unease? When you're feeling 
                fidgety, you're looking for something to satisfy that unease and to make you comfortable. 
                Sometimes a pencil scratches that itch, sometimes you pick your fingernails, 
                or bounce your leg and you feel at ease for the moment. What happens when you 
                run out of fingernails, or you become bored of your pencil? I'm telling you, 
                this fidget spinner is the most satisfying fidget. You'll not only fidget with 
                it, you'll be entertained by it. Your friends will be obssesed with it even more 
                than you are, and we already know they'll steal it from you, and if they don't you'll 
                lose it eventually. If you fidget, we can assume that you have a tendancy to lose 
                everything, so we decided to price the fidget spinner in consideration of your 
                forgetfullness and thieving friends. At just $1.99 per spinner, you can fidget to your heart's satisfaction. </p>
